## LocalMotion

We are a group dedicated to solving the crisis of econonmic mobility that has plagued our communities in North Carolina. We want to provide an alternative solution because the solution originally was to push education, but it has become quite clear that education alone is simply not the answer. College education in North Carolina is too expensive as it currently stands which means that it is up to us to find different solutions. Our app is tackling the problem in a substantial way that we feel our competitors are not. We have created an app designed to help people micro-finance and put it towards clothing, internet, and impactful assets that are designated to promote individual's ablitiy to obtain jobs.
